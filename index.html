      <h1>About Me</h1>

      <div id="intro">
        <p>Hi, I’m <strong>Shivam Damani</strong>, a 25-year-old Indian-American living in New York City.</p>
  
        <p>
          In my professional life, I’m a Data Scientist with a strong academic foundation. 
          I did my undergrad at the Indian Institute of Technology, Madras, 
          and I am currently pursuing a graduate degree at the University of Pennsylvania. 
          Right now, I’m part of an incredible team at Mayo Clinic, 
          helping to make sense of complex data and contributing to projects that aim to improve healthcare.
        </p>

        <p>
          Outside of work, I am a runner, I enjoy learning about the history of NYC, and being outdoors in nature.
