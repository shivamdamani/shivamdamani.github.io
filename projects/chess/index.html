      <h1>Chess Game Analysis</h1>

      <p>
        Chess is a game of strategy, tactics, and calculation. In this project, I used data from
        <a href="https://lichess.org/" target="_blank">Lichess</a>, an online chess platform, to analyze games, explore patterns,
        and visualize strategies used by players.
      </p>

      <h3>Objective</h3>
      <p>
        The goal of this project is to analyze a collection of chess games, extract meaningful insights from the
        players' moves, and visualize key strategies. By analyzing the data, I aim to better understand player
        strengths and weaknesses and how they change based on the opening moves, mid-game, and end-game strategies.
      </p>

      <h3>Tools Used</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Python</li>
        <li>Pandas for data manipulation</li>
        <li>Matplotlib for visualizations</li>
        <li>Stockfish, an open-source chess engine, for move analysis</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Data and Analysis</h3>
      <p>
        The data for this project includes thousands of chess games from Lichess, which were analyzed for move patterns,
        player ratings, game outcomes, and strategies. Below are a few highlights from the analysis:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Opening Moves:</strong> The data shows that players with higher Elo ratings tend to prefer classical openings
          like the Ruy Lopez, while lower-rated players tend to experiment more with non-standard openings.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Mid-Game Tactics:</strong> Tactics such as forks, pins, and discovered attacks were identified using Stockfish
          evaluations and move patterns.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Endgame Strategies:</strong> High-rated players tend to win a higher percentage of their games in the endgame
          through accurate pawn promotion strategies.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Visualizations</h3>
      <p>
        The following chart visualizes player ratings against their win rates, showing that higher-rated players
        tend to win more often in shorter games:

      <h3>Conclusion</h3>
      <p>
        This project provided valuable insights into chess strategies across different rating levels. By combining
        data analysis and chess engine evaluations, we can better understand the tactics and strategies used by
        players in different phases of the game.
