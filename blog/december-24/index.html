          December - final exams, snowy runs, travel for work, and the holidays. It was a month of reflection for the year past and planning for the year ahead. Iâ€™ve enjoyed looking back on the lessons learned, milestones achieved, and the progress Iâ€™ve made both personally and professionally.

        <h2>Looking back on December</h2>
        <p>
          The first two weeks of December were spent mostly with finishing up projects for grad school, and preparing and taking my finals. Then came a quick work trip back to Minnesota. NYC received some snow in the last week of the year, and I enjoyed running through Central Park with everything looking white!
        </p>
        <p>
          I was quite stressed about my exams initially - but everything went pretty well. The week after, I had no idea what to do with all the free time on my hands in the evening! I went to a lot of group runs in the winter and made some new friends. I hope to be able to keep that up in the new year, I've enjoyed the social part of running too. Visiting Minnesota was a nice change too. The weather was quite bad, it was 31 F and the roads had iced out to the point where kids were ice skating on them! 
        </p>

          Marathon training has been going well too. My body has adapted to the increased mileage, and I have also found easy high protein meals to power me through this. I have not been strength training, which I hope to be better about in January. I saw a statistic recentlyThis month I joined a few reading clubs in the city.

          Thinking back to 2024, I was quite ashamed to say that I only read 2 books in full. I joined a few reading related clubs in the city to help me stay more accountable with my reading. I hope to have read 12 books in 2025!

        <h2>Running and Fitness</h2>
        <p>
          I got started on my 20 week marathon plan this month. I am a bit nervous about the marathon distance, but I am also excited for all that I learn about running and myself on this journey. I went to REI and picked out every running gel I could find to try out on my longer runs. I hope to find what works for me. With all the free time this month, I've been going to social running events in the city. It is interesting to have new people to run with and learn from. A
