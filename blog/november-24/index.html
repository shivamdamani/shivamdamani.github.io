      <h2>November 2024</h2>
      <h1>My First Blog Post: Why I created this website and what I plan to share here</h1>      
      <hr>
      <div class="blog-post-content">
        <p>
          My first blog post - welcome! In this post, I want to share why I created this website and what I plan to share here. The motivation behind this blog is to have a space where I can document and reflect on both my personal and professional journey. My aim is to post monthly updates covering a mix of topics: what I’ve been up to, lessons I’ve learned, insights from projects I’m working on, and even thoughts on life and productivity. This website is both a creative outlet and a way for me to stay accountable in documenting my growth.
        </p>
        <br>
        <h2>Who Am I?</h2>
        <p>
          I’m Shivam Damani, a 25-year-old Indian-American living in New York City. By day, I’m a data scientist at the Mayo Clinic and a graduate student at the University of Pennsylvania. By night (or early mornings), I’m a runner - I am currently training for my first marathon. I love the history and landmarks all around New York City. I also enjoy camping in national parks when I can find some time. This blog is my attempt to tie together these facets of my life.

        <h2>Why This Blog?</h2>
        <p>
          Glad you asked! I’ve been off Instagram and most social media for about five years now. Recently, while catching up with an old friend, they pulled out their Instagram to show me highlights from the past few years. It made me realize I miss having a way to document my own journey—something like a highlight reel, but without the filters and pressure of perfection.
        </p>
        <p>
          So, why not just return to Instagram? Because I want something deeper and more meaningful—a space where I can reflect on my life without the trap of comparison or the need to perform. This blog is my way of creating that space.
        </p>
        <p>
          With this website, I plan to write monthly posts about what’s been going on in my life. I want to remember what I was up to in my 20s—not just the big moments, but the small ones too. Plus, I see this as a great opportunity to showcase my professional work, with sections for my projects and whatever else is on my mind in the future.
        </p>
        <br>
        <h2>Running and Fitness</h2>
        <p>
          With my first marathon 23 weeks away, I’ve been laying the groundwork for serious training. I’m currently running about 30 miles a week to build a solid base for the longer runs ahead. Over the past two years, I’ve had phases where my running routine, strength training, and diet were all strong—but rarely at the same time. Now, I’m focused on consistency and bringing it all together for this marathon.
        </p>
        <p>
          This month, I had the chance to visit Philadelphia for school, and it was a treat for my running routine. I ran along the scenic Schuylkill River, and passed by the iconic Philadelphia Museum of Art with its famous Rocky steps (while listening to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_YYmfM2TfUA" target="_blank">Gonna Fly Now</a>). A <a href="https://strava.app.link/Jaw5aXX0MOb" target="_blank">standout run</a> was a 10-mile effort at 8:39 min/mile—a pace I’m proud of as I gear up for more intense training.

        <h2>Graduate School</h2>
        <p>
          After several years away from school, it feels great to be back in the classroom. I missed the challenges of math, and the coursework and exams have scratched an intellectual itch I hadn’t felt in a long time. It’s been both exciting and rewarding to be back in school.
        </p>
        <p>
          This month, I worked on a project analyzing NYC traffic data to predict collision risks. More about the results and insights in December.
        </p>

        <h2>Exploring NYC</h2>
        <p>
          I’m sure everyone across the globe has been exposed to NYC in one way or another. My earliest memory of the city is watching Ben Stiller’s Night at the Museum with my mom. NYC is such a cultural icon, and I love discovering the spots where famous events occurred, learning about influential residents, and diving into US history and pop culture. In this section, I want to share a piece of trivia or history I learn each month while living here.
        </p>
        <p>
          For November, I discovered the story of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PS_General_Slocum" target="_blank">General Slocum Disaster</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
          We’ve all heard of 9/11 and the Titanic (some forget that the Titanic was headed to NYC)—tragic incidents that remind us of the fragility of life and the resilience of New Yorkers in responding to tragedy. A lesser-known story I recently stumbled upon during my runs is the General Slocum Disaster. For months, I ran by this spot every day, unaware of its history, until I decided to dig deeper.
        </p>
        <p>
          The PS General Slocum was a passenger steamboat that caught fire and sank in the East River, just off Astoria Park. On June 15, 1904, the vessel caught fire, and 1,021 out of 1,342 people on board lost their lives. For eight years, it was the deadliest maritime disaster in US history, until the Titanic tragedy in 1912. Learning about this event gave me a deeper appreciation for the layers of history that surround us in NYC.
        </p>

        <h2>Habit I’m Building</h2>
        <p>
          How many times have you thought to yourself, “I really need to make that a habit”? If you’re anything like me, the answer is far too often. In this section, I want to focus on one habit each month, work on making it part of my routine, and share what I learn along the way—successes, failures, and everything in between.
        </p>
        <p>
          This month, I dedicated time most days to building this website. I’m happy to have the groundwork in place and look forward to continuing to improve it over time. For December, my goal is to establish a consistent skincare routine. It’s something I’ve been meaning to do for a while, and I’m curious to see how I’ll feel after a month of sticking to it.
        </p>
        <br>
        <h2>Personal Updates</h2>
        <p>
          If there’s anything left in my life that I haven’t shared above, it will go here. November flew by! Between work, school, and trying to stay on top of everything, it’s been a whirlwind.
        </p>
        <p>
          The other update for November: I applied to be a Big Brother with the Big Brothers Big Sisters of NYC. I’ve been wanting to find a way to give back to the community, and I’m excited about the opportunity to mentor and connect with someone who could benefit from a positive influence.
        </p>
        <br>  
        <p>
          That’s it for November! I’m excited to see where this blog goes and how it evolves over time. Thanks for reading, and if you have feedback, thoughts, or just want to say hi, feel free to reach out!
