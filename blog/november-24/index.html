      <h2>My First Blog Post: Why I created this website and what I plan to share here.</h2>      
      <hr>
      <div class="blog-post-content">
        <p>
          My first blog post - welcome! In this post, I want to share why I created this website and what I plan to share here. The motivation behind this blog is to have a space where I can document and reflect on both my personal and professional journey. My aim is to post monthly updates covering a mix of topics: what I’ve been up to, lessons I’ve learned, insights from projects I’m working on, and even thoughts on life and productivity. This website is both a creative outlet and a way for me to stay accountable in documenting my growth.
        </p>

        <h2>Who Am I?</h2>
        <p>
          I’m Shivam Damani, a 25-year-old Indian-American living in New York City. By day, I’m a data scientist at the Mayo Clinic and a graduate student at UPenn. By night (or early mornings), I’m a runner, NYC explorer, and a bit of a nerd when it comes to movies, books, and podcasts. This blog is my attempt to tie together these facets of my life, one post at a time.
        </p>
        <br>
        <h2>Running and Fitness</h2>
        <p>
          Training for a marathon has been a lesson in perseverance and consistency. This month, I’ve been focusing on hitting weekly mileage goals and testing out new routes in NYC. (Favorite route of the month: along the Hudson River!)
        </p>
        <br>
        <h2>Data Science at UPenn</h2>
        <p>
          Graduate school has been a mix of excitement and challenges. This month, I worked on a fascinating project analyzing NYC traffic data to predict collision risks. It’s amazing to see how data science can contribute to solving real-world problems.
        </p>
        <br>
        <h2>NYC Explorations</h2>
        <p>
          This city never gets old! I discovered a hidden gem in the form of a cozy vegan cafe in Brooklyn and finally visited the High Line after sunset—it’s magical with all the city lights.
        </p>
        <br>
        <h2>What I’m Watching, Reading, or Listening To</h2>
        <p>
          Watching: *The Bear* (it’s as intense as everyone says!)<br>
          Reading: *Atomic Habits* by James Clear (finally)<br>
          Listening to: *The Daily* podcast on my morning runs.
        </p>
        <br>
        <h2>Habit I’m Building</h2>
        <p>
          This month, I’ve been trying to journal daily. It’s been a great way to clear my head and reflect on what’s working and what’s not.
        </p>
        <br>
        <h2>Personal Updates</h2>
        <p>
          November flew by! Between work, school, and trying to stay on top of everything, it’s been a whirlwind. One highlight: setting a personal best in a 10K run (52 minutes!).
        </p>

        <br>
  
        <p>
          That’s it for November! I’m excited to see where this blog goes and how it evolves over time. Thanks for reading, and if you have feedback, thoughts, or just want to say hi, feel free to reach out!
